# TypeScript Best Practices

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when you need to:

- Implement TypeScript code following best practices
- Refactor JavaScript to TypeScript
- Improve type safety and code maintainability
- Choose between different TypeScript patterns
- Teach or explain TypeScript best practices
- Review code for TypeScript anti-patterns

## Instructions

1. **Identify the pattern**: Which best practice applies to your situation?
2. **Apply the pattern**: Follow the code examples provided
3. **Verify types**: Ensure TypeScript infers the correct types
4. **Test usage**: Confirm autocomplete and type checking work as expected

## Best Practices

- Use `as const` Instead of Enums: read at [as-const-pattern](assets/as-const-pattern.ts)
