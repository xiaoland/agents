# Code Smell Checker for TypeScript + Vue Projects

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when you need to:

- Review code generated by AI or written by developers for maintainability issues
- Conduct code quality assessments and identify potential technical debt
- Check TypeScript type design for semantic clarity and maintainability
- Review Vue component architecture and responsibility boundaries
- Validate reactive data handling patterns (ref, reactive, computed, watch)
- Ensure adherence to best practices in Vue 3 + TypeScript projects
- Identify code smells that could impact long-term maintainability

## What this skill covers

This skill provides comprehensive checklists for three main areas:

1. **TypeScript Type Design** - Type organization, semantic clarity, coupling, extensibility
2. **Vue Component Design** - Component responsibilities, props design, state management
3. **Reactive Data Handling** - Reactivity depth, computed patterns, watch usage, ref vs reactive

## Instructions

### Performing a Code Review

Follow these steps to review code for maintainability issues:

1. **Identify the review scope**:
   - Determine which area(s) to focus on (types, components, or reactive data)
   - Identify the files or modules to review

2. **Read the relevant checklist**:
   - For TypeScript types: See [typescript-types.md](references/typescript-types.md)
   - For Vue components: See [vue-components.md](references/vue-components.md)
   - For reactive data: See [reactive-data.md](references/reactive-data.md)

3. **Apply the checklist systematically**:
   - Go through each category in the relevant reference document
   - Check the code against each item in the checklist
   - Note any violations or concerns

4. **Prioritize findings**:
   - Categorize issues by severity (critical, important, minor)
   - Focus on issues that impact maintainability and scalability
   - Consider the project context and team standards

5. **Provide actionable feedback**:
   - Explain why each issue is a problem
   - Show the "bad smell" pattern identified
   - Suggest concrete improvements with code examples
   - Reference the specific checklist item for context

### Quick Reference: Common Code Smells

**TypeScript Types**:
- Type definitions scattered across files instead of centralized
- Using `any`, `object`, or overly broad types instead of precise types
- Complex type gymnastics that are hard to understand
- Types that don't match runtime reality

**Vue Components**:
- Components doing too many things (>300 lines)
- Props drilling through multiple levels
- Mixing local state, global state, and derived state
- Missing or weak prop type definitions

**Reactive Data**:
- Deep reactive tracking on large datasets
- Computed properties with side effects
- Using `watch` for data transformations instead of `computed`
- Incorrect `ref` vs `reactive` usage

### Integration with Development Workflow

**During Code Review**:
- Use this skill to systematically check pull requests
- Focus on one category at a time for thorough review
- Document findings with specific checklist references

**During Development**:
- Consult relevant checklists when designing new features
- Use as a guide for refactoring existing code
- Reference best practices when making architectural decisions

**For Team Standards**:
- Adapt checklists to match your team's coding standards
- Use as basis for automated linting rules where possible
- Include in onboarding materials for new team members

## Best Practices

**Be Constructive**:
- Focus on maintainability and clarity, not personal preferences
- Explain the "why" behind each code smell
- Provide concrete examples of better alternatives
- Recognize when breaking rules makes sense for the context

**Be Systematic**:
- Review one category at a time to avoid overwhelm
- Use the checklist format to ensure thorough coverage
- Document patterns for future reference
- Track recurring issues to identify systemic problems

**Be Pragmatic**:
- Not all items in the checklist will apply to every project
- Consider the project's maturity and constraints
- Balance idealism with practical realities
- Focus on high-impact issues first

## Output Format

When reporting code smells, use this structure:

```
## Code Review: [Component/Module Name]

### Category: [TypeScript Types / Vue Components / Reactive Data]

#### Issue 1: [Brief description]
- **Severity**: [Critical / Important / Minor]
- **Location**: file.ts:line
- **Checklist Reference**: [Link to specific section]
- **Problem**: [Explain the issue]
- **Recommendation**: [Suggest improvement]
- **Example**: [Show better code if applicable]
```

**Note**: This skill is designed to complement human judgment, not replace it. Use the checklists as guidelines and adapt them to your project's specific needs and constraints.
