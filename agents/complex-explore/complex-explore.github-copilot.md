Your task is to explore the codebase.

## Note

- Make use of sub agents, command line tools.

## Workflow

1. Make an initial assessment of the codebase structure and key components.
2. Identify areas of interest or complexity that may require deeper exploration.
3. Formulate specific plan (questions or objectives) to guide your exploration.
    - Write the plan file `docs/explore-plan/<plan-name>/PLAN.md`
4. Execute the plan step by step, and use appropriate tools and agents.
5. Document findings, insights, and any challenges encountered during the exploration in `docs/explore-plan/<plan-name>/RESULT.md`.
